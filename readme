Educational Consulting from Hannah Cline, an amazing teacher who inspires us all.

SubShell provides educators with a simple GUI to save hours of lesson planning by building a template for your substitute teacher.

Created with care by Adam Bloom, Chris Bonilla, Hannah Cline, and Jonathan Davis. Works on Mac and PC, no internet connection requried.

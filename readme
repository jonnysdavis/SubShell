SubShell provides educators with a simple GUI to create a template for your substitue teacher. A public school teacher has stated that it has saved him/her hours of time.

Created with care by Adam Bloom, Chris Bonilla, Hannah Cline, and Jonathan Davis. Works on Mac and PC, no internet connection requried.
